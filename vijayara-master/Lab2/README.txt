What did you learn in this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab were to figure out how to compare bits and output the greater, less than and equal bits, with the comparator. Then create a truth table for the adder and figure out how to implement the circuits for it. Then it was important to know how a D flip flop works when implementing the register. A big concept was also the 2s Complement for the greater than bit. If the 2s Complement is not implemented well, then it would output the bit for -15 (F) or wouldn't have the negative sign. 

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I encountered a lot of issues during this lab and I had to get help for a lot of steps.I went to lab sections for 15 hours for this lab and went to office hours at 9 am on Friday. I even started on the lab last week and I was still almost not able to finish the lab. I especially struggled with the 2s Complement. I wasn't able to subtract it properly and it would often create weird calculations that weren't correct. I found it enjoyable when I understood how to do the lab. I also liked it when I figured out how to a simpler method to do compute the values of +1 or +2 for the less than or equal to values. 


How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would make it more straightforward and easier to understand. I would also have a clear outline since the steps weren't clear and I was really confused. I finally starting understanding after I went to multiple lab sections, but I still had bugs in my lab that I couldn't figure out how to fix. This was a really hard lab and I don't think it should have been this hard, especially because I've spent all my time on this lab and haven't had time to study for midterms.
