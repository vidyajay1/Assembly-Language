LAB 1: Intro to Logic Simulation
CMPE 012 Fall 2018

-------------------------

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned a lot of things. I learned how to use MML logic, first of all. I learned how to connect receivers to senders and how to implement logic gates properly. I got a better understanding of the logic behind the truth table for different types of gates. I learned how to test my logic gates using switches. 

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
I found parts A and B to be more straightforward. But once I got into part C, I got confused with the logic gates. I was using too many gates to properly connect all of the senders together, which messed up my implementation of the truth table. I also had trouble figuring out how to use only the NOR gates, since certain variations of the switches didn’t match the truth table when I tested it.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I think the lab is pretty good. Maybe it would be helpful to assign a page to a part of the lab. So part A goes on the page 2 of Lab1.lgi. Part B goes on page 3. Part C (SOP/POS) goes on page 4. Part C (NAND only) goes on page 5. And the optional extra credit goes on page 6. This way I wouldn’t have to label what page is for what part of the lab. But this is a minor and rather irrelevant change for the overall lab.
