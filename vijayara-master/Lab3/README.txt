-------------------------
The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) and output strings (“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?

The range of addresses in which these strings are stored are 0x10010000 through 0x1001002F. 

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives in this lab were to learn about how to program and code in MIPS, learn about registers and how to loop and create branches. Also, it was essential to understand how to use temporary registers, $t0-$t9. Also, printing out these register values and strings using syscall was important to know.   

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I encountered issues at the end because it kept outputting Flux and then the value of $t1, or i, instead of just outputting Flux. I had to switch some of my branches around and change some of my conditions to fix this. I found it enjoyable when I started understanding MIPS after reading the textbook. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I actually liked this lab and wouldn't redesign it. It was pretty straightforward and simpler, which was a good way to start learning and transitioning into MIPS. If I had to redesign it, I would give an extra credit part or just a rule. For this, the coder would not be allowed to just use a space after Flux.
